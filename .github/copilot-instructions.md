# Documentation Guidelines

1. **Feature Documentation**:
    - All new features must be documented in a `.md` file located in the `docs` folder.
    - Include usage examples, expected behavior, and any relevant details about the feature.

2. **README Updates**:
    - Ensure that all new feature documentation is linked from the `README.md` file located in the workspace root.
    - Provide a clear and concise description of the feature in the `README.md` with a link to the detailed documentation.

3. **Documentation Standards**:
    - Use clear and consistent formatting in `.md` files.
    - Include code snippets, diagrams, or examples where applicable to improve clarity.
    - Ensure documentation is updated promptly whenever a feature is modified or enhanced.

## General Guidelines
1. **Programming Language**: Use Python as the primary programming language wherever possible.
2. **Type Annotations**: Ensure all Python code includes proper type annotations for function arguments and return types to improve code readability and maintainability.
3. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for all new features. Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## Workflow
1. **Feature Development**:
    - Write clean, modular, and well-documented Python code.
    - Use type annotations to specify input and output types for all functions and methods.

2. **Testing**:
    - For every new feature, create corresponding test cases.
    - Ensure tests cover edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected outputs.
    - Use automated testing tools to validate the code.

3. **Code Review**:
    - Submit code for peer review before merging into the main branch.
    - Address all review comments promptly.

4. **Documentation**:
    - Document all new features, including usage examples and expected behavior.
    - Update any relevant README or API documentation.
